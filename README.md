# Node.js TypeScript Assessment API
A simple RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**, without any external frameworks like Express. This project loads sample data from JSONPlaceholder and provides CRUD operations for users, their posts, and comments.

# Features
- Load mock data (users, posts, comments) from JSONPlaceholder API
- View user details with their posts and associated comments
- Create a new user
- Delete a user and all their related data
- Delete all users and related data
- No external web frameworks (e.g., Express)
- MongoDB for data storage
- TypeScript for static typing
